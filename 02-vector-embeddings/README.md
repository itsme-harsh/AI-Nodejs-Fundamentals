## 02 - Vector Embeddings in AI Models

✅ What Are Embeddings?

- Embeddings are numerical vector representations of text that capture semantic meaning. They allow AI models to measure similarity between texts, which is essential for:
  Search engines
  RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
  Recommendation systems
  Clustering and classification

✅ Why Use Embeddings?

- Semantic Search: Find similar documents or questions.
- Contextual Understanding: Vectors represent meaning, not just words.
- Cost Efficiency: Embedding once and storing for reuse saves API calls.
